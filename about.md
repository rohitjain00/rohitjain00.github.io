Hi, I am Rohit jain currently final year undergradutate at [JIIT](http://www.jiit.ac.in/) with Computer Science and Engineering as major.

I have a huge interest in creating web applications with managing all the aspects of it i.e. the frontend(Angular, React), backend(Flask-Rest-API), database(MongoDB, using ORM over SQL, graphql), hosting (gh-pages, aws, Heroku) and managing domain. Also, I have experience in creating Flutter applications using firebase as the backend service.

Further, I am experienced in using Docker and Docker-compose for packaging an application along with the Continuous Integration and Continuous Development of the application. In a recent project, I've also used AWS, making me familiar with the microservices and how to use it to scale an application.

I have interest in finance and love reading about it. I also created a trading bot for cryptocurrency and worked on an options strategy generator.
