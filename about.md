            <p>Well - I'm an ardent politics buff, frustrated lover of literature, tech geek, die-hard quizzer, Formula 1 fanatic, and a hard rock fan. <br> <br>In the immortal words Popeye the Sailor Man -- "I yam what I yam and that's all what I yam"</p>

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p class="text-justify">At present, I am working as an Assistant Professor of English at Royal Global University, Guwahati where I am also the Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Coordinator for Value Added Courses.  
  I am also reading for a PhD from Gauhati University with a dissertation focused on Post-Soviet Immigration Literature. The title of my dissertation is - "Hybrid Cultures, Plural Identities: (De)Constructing the Hyphen in Contemporary Russian-American Literature".</p>
